The starter kit is built on top of the Creative Editor SDK. 
Built to support versatile editing capabilities for a broad range of design applications.
Toggling from edit and pages modes enables users to evaluate their design within the full context of their design project.
A dock at the bottom of the editor provides quick access to the most essential design editing tools allowing users to overlay text, add images, shapes, stickers and upload new image assets.
